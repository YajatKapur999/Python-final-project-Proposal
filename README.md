Stock Visualizer and Analysis Tool


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Python script that graphs stock prices and provides detailed information on specific stocks, including historical data, performance metrics, and other relevant analytics.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The software will allow users to input a stock ticker, retrieve historical price data, and display it in an interactive graph. Additional features might include showing key metrics like daily highs, lows, and averages, as well as relevant financial information about the stock (e.g., P/E ratio, market cap). The program will use a data API, such as Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance, for real-time data access. Users can adjust time ranges, and there will be a summary of each stock’s historical performance.



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
Include additional stock metrics like daily high, low, average, and volume. Allow users to set a custom date range for analysis.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Add additional stock metrics, such as daily high, low, average, and trading volume. Enable users to select custom date ranges for viewing and analyzing stock trends. Implement simple technical indicators, like moving averages, to help users identify price trends over time.




### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 Implement advanced analytics such as moving averages and trend indicators. Provide an option to compare multiple stocks on the same graph.




## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?


To complete this project, I’ll need to gain proficiency in API requests and parsing JSON data. Research topics include accessing financial APIs, data visualization libraries (such as Matplotlib or Plotly), and working with Python data manipulation libraries (like Pandas).
